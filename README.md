How to Play
Use the left and right arrow keys to move between lanes, you will hear a whooshing sound when this happens
Use the down arrow to slide, you will hear a gravel sliding sound; this will come in handy to avoid swinging signs that are creaking
Use the up arrow to jump, boing sound, which will help collect coins, shimmer sound
There are a total of 3 lives which can be lost anytime you hit a train or sign followed by an umph sound
When all three lives are lost or there are no more coins to earn, the game will end
